# Abstract

Flaked stone artefacts from Southeast Asia typically lack visually distinctive and strongly
patterned forms, which can make them challenging to analyze and interpret. As a result,
many of the cultural dynamics of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers of this region are poorly
understood. We use 2D shape data to hypothesize a relationship between unretouched
flake shape and assemblage reduction intensity at Mau A, an early Holocene archaeo-
logical site in northern Vietnam. We apply a Principal Components Analysis to the flake
outlines to investigate shape variation throughout the reduction sequence (measured
by dorsal cortex coverage). We find that flake shape varies by reduction stage, primarily
through differences in flake length and width. Our results suggest that flake shape is
sensitive to assemblage reduction intensity, and may give useful comparative insights
when other attributes show little variation. These results are important for understanding
stone artefact assemblages from Southeast Asia which often yield little variation when
analysed with traditional approaches.

## Introduction

- Stone tools from South East Asia tend to lack distinctive typological categories (Mijares 2008; Borel et al. 2013; Borel et al. 2017)
- The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between flake shape and reduction intensity
- Approach used in the paper is a response to the lack of traditional typological categories in South East Asia

## Background

- Mau A is an open air site located near the Red River in Yen Bai Province, Northern Vietnam.
- Excavation conducted in 2015 as a part of a UW field school
- A wide array of flakes and stone tools were recovered, n=1058
- Data for the paper comes from caliper measurements of flakes from the 2015 excavation

## Methods

The data used for our analysis came from a 2015 dig at Mau A, located in Northern Vietnam, conducted by a University of Washington field school in conjunction with local archaeologists. (Insert more info about dig methods here) 

Raw flake dimension measurements, such as max dimension length and width at various points along the max dimension length, were converted into shape landmarks values using an R script (see X for supplementary material). The outlines formed by the shape landmarks were then normalized for size. Our methodology for carrying out the PCA on the shape landmarks was inspired by Theska et al. (2020), which also performed 2D landmark data analysis using PCA. Finally, the shape landmark values were passed through Primary Component Analysis. PCA biplots were created to visualize differences based upon secondary categorical variables, namely flake reduction categories, excavation unit, and mass cluster. 

Reduction categories were based upon dorsal cortex percentage. Flakes with no dorsal cortex were categorized as tertiary flakes, those with up to a dorsal cortex percentage of 50% were considered secondary and those with a dorsal cortex value greater than 50% were considered primary (Bradbury & Carr 1995). Artefacts collected from Mau A were separated into 13 excavation units, with 1 being the closest to the surface and 13 being the deepest. Mass clusters were generated using univariate k-means, with the end result being 6 mass clusters, with mass cluster 1 having the least mass on average and 6 having the greatest mass on average. 

(QH here, I am not sure what else to write regarding the methods. I think the primary task here is to include references to where our code may be found as well as more information on the dig itself. I just want to avoid the issue of going over our entire thought process as opposed to what was directly done to produce our results)

## Results

<!-- Here's some example analysis code: -->

```{r get-data, eval = FALSE}
# Note the path that we need to use to access our data files when rendering this document
my_data <- read.csv(here::here('analysis/data/raw_data/my_csv_file.csv'))
```

```{r demo-plot, fig.cap="A plot of random numbers"}
plot(rnorm(10))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:demo-plot) shows how we can have a caption and cross-reference for a plot

```{r demo-inline-code}
x <- round(pi, 2)
```

Here is an example of inline code `r x` in the middle of a sentence.
